Mousing over doesn't work for things that have been shaken
Some minor aesthetic bugs with shifting beakers
Some major BEAKER GO BYE BYES
- happened after making methylbenzene
- maybe to do with shake bug as doesn't happen always
-temporary fix necessary since makes unplayable, fix by changing disappearance parameters

When prepared oxovanadium (V), when shook beaker, reaction beaker did a funny thing.
This probaby has to be fixed in the react function

When pour chemicals, somehow they do not get put back on the shelf if last poured sometimes

Make so that cannot pick up beaker if shelf is open

Fix some descriptions, and for aesthetic reasons make description lower
