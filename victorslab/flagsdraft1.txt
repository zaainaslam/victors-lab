[This is for the forgotten,]
[For the unloved,]
[And the unwanted.]

[Would you know what I'm talking about?]

[No... of course you wouldn't...]

[Would you like to know...?]
[You can, soon..]

Firefly leads to backsprite of ghostie. Enters the sprite from the top.
-enter creepy stuff if you can, once you're in the mood

[Have... fun... if you can... if you deserve it...]

creepy smile? Or is it too early to show face?

-some traumatic shit


[Oi...]
[OI! BETH! BETH!]

Wakes up on bus. Kat is looking at her.

Kat: [Were you having a nightmare?]
[You looked like you were struggling there, but I didn't want to wake you yet.]
[Anyway, we're there, get your stuff]

Beth looks confused, in a sleepy daze

Kat: [You're still half asleep, aren't you?]
[You're hopeless. Here]

Kat gives you your bag

[This is the item bar, each slot corresponds to a number key on your keyboard.]
[You can access your bag using the 0 key]

Hazel: [Wait, Beth, here's your autograph book.]

Hazel gives you the autograph book

[The autograph book can be selected from the item bar. Choose it to read it!]

Hazel: [We all wrote in it, why don't you check it out?]

Beth has to check the book here, and flip all the way to the back to see that
the teacher also wrote in it.

Hazel: [We even got Miss Winters to write in it, isn't that neat?]
[She may be old but she's still such a chill teacher]

All the girls get off the bus, and they get their first look at the castle.

Kat: [It looks...]
[Like the kind of place where a million people died a long time ago?]

Tess: [The place itself looks like it died a long time ago]

Miss Winters: [Incidentally, Kat, that did happen.]
[You know the war?  Hostages taken from the rebel side were kept here and interrogated under  the watch of  Lord NAME. He was infamously cruel. Once he was done with them, they were executed and  their bodies  were buried in a mass grave with no respect for proper burial rites. One day, there was a fire that was started by the rebels. They had prior warning so most of them were able to leave the castle once the commotion started, but a few of them stayed behind to ensure the Lord burned. None of the Lord's servants knew, so they burned to death too. Afterwards, the rebels who lived relocated the bodies from the mass grave to a proper graveyard, and restoration efforts of the building started a century later when it was deemed a historical place.]
